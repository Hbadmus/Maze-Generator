I leveraged Kruskal's Algorithm to  craft spanning trees, resulting in the generation of an extensive collection of diverse and intricate mazes. These mazes were elevated to a new level of engagement through the dynamic animations seamlessly integrated with "Impworld." This allowed for the vivid representation of the search speed and the intricacies of maze traversal.

For the optimization of maze-solving strategies, I strategically incorporated both Breadth First Search and Depth First Search Algorithms. By doing so, I ensured the efficient application of search techniques, enhancing the user experience by providing not only a challenging environment but also fostering the development of problem-solving skills.
